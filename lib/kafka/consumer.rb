module Kafka

  # @note This code is still alpha level. Don't use this for anything important.
  #   The API may also change without warning.
  #
  # A client that consumes messages from a Kafka cluster in coordination with
  # other clients.
  #
  # A Consumer subscribes to one or more Kafka topics; all consumers with the
  # same *group id* then agree on who should read from the individual topic
  # partitions. When group members join or leave, the group synchronizes,
  # making sure that all partitions are assigned to a single member, and that
  # all members have some partitions to read from.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # A simple producer that simply writes the messages it consumes to the
  # console.
  #
  #     require "kafka"
  #
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(seed_brokers: ["kafka1:9092", "kafka2:9092"])
  #
  #     # Create a new Consumer instance in the group `my-group`:
  #     consumer = kafka.consumer(group_id: "my-group")
  #
  #     # Subscribe to a Kafka topic:
  #     consumer.subscribe("messages")
  #
  #     # Loop forever, reading in messages from all topics that have been
  #     # subscribed to.
  #     consumer.each_message do |message|
  #       puts message.topic
  #       puts message.partition
  #       puts message.key
  #       puts message.value
  #       puts message.offset
